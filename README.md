# transformers for stock price prediction



'Maximize profit and minimize loss', what every institution is trying to achieve... Modern financial markets are dynamic by nature, characterised by nonlinear and unpredictable behaviour, 
making accurate prediction of prices and returns a very challenging task. There is great value creation in understanding market behaviour and forecasting stock prices. As technology advances, 
the financial world is relying on quantitative modeling to recreate this non linearity in the market. Recent work by for example has proved that Machine Learning algorithms can be powerful enough to extract latent information, empowering them with the possibility and potential to outperform simple linear models. 
It is also important to note that Machine Learning based models allow to avoid human judgement tainted by bias and subject to a human brain's cognitive limits. In this project, we aim at utilising a very modern architecture, namely transformers to predict individual stock prices, mostly from the SP500. Initially, transformers were developed for language processing purposes, however, they have started to be recently applied in time series predictions. 
The core of this architecture is in its attention mechanism which would potentially allow it to learn and explain non-linearity in the stock market in an even better way. Then, We compare our findings to two baseline models created for the purpose of 
this project. We propose a first simple approach in which we make use of time series forecasting using linear regressionto predict the future stock price. After that, we build an LSTM architecture for the same purpose.
In the latter, the goal will be to show that transformers can mimic the performance of already well established architectures in the field and even outperform them in the long run.
